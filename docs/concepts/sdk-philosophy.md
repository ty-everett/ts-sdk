# SDK Design Philosophy

This document details the core principles behind the BSV TypeScript SDK architecture and design decisions.

## Zero Dependencies

The SDK is built without external dependencies to:

- Minimize security attack surface
- Reduce bundle size and complexity
- Ensure long-term stability
- Provide predictable behavior

## SPV-First Approach

The SDK prioritizes Simplified Payment Verification:

- **Lightweight**: No need to download the full blockchain
- **Efficient**: Verify transactions using merkle proofs
- **Scalable**: Works with millions of transactions
- **Secure**: Cryptographically verifiable without full nodes

## Vendor Neutrality

The SDK works with any compliant Bitcoin infrastructure:

- **Wallet Agnostic**: Supports any BRC-100 compliant wallet
- **Network Flexible**: Works with different chain tracking services
- **Service Independent**: No lock-in to specific providers

## Modular Design

Components are designed to work independently:

- **Composable**: Mix and match functionality as needed
- **Extensible**: Easy to add custom implementations
- **Testable**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## TypeScript-First

Built specifically for TypeScript to provide:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Developer Experience**: Rich IDE support and autocomplete
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Reliability**: Reduced runtime errors

## Security by Design

Security considerations are built into every component:

- **Cryptographic Primitives**: Secure implementations of Bitcoin cryptography
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Best Practices**: Follows established security patterns

## Performance Focused

Optimized for real-world application needs:

- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory footprint
- **Fast Execution**: Optimized critical paths
- **Batch Processing**: Support for high-throughput scenarios
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching where appropriate

## Developer-Friendly

Designed to make Bitcoin development accessible:

- **Clear APIs**: Intuitive method names and parameters
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, and references
- **Working Examples**: Real code that developers can use immediately
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
