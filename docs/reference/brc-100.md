# BRC-100 Wallet Interface

[BRC-100](https://brc.dev/100) defines a Unified, Vendor-Neutral, Unchanging, and Open BSV Blockchain Standard Wallet-to-Application Interface which is implemented in this library within the WalletClient class. The API is laid out here as a swagger openapi document to offer a fast-track to understanding the interface which is implemented across multiple substrates. The JSON api is generally considered a developer friendly introduction to the WalletClient, where an binary equivalent ABI may be preferred for production use cases.

## Wallet JSON API

- [Wallet JSON API Swagger](../swagger)

## Overview

The BRC-100 standard provides a consistent interface for applications to interact with BSV wallets, regardless of the underlying wallet implementation. This ensures that applications can work with any BRC-100 compliant wallet without modification.

## Key Features

- **Vendor Neutral**: Works with any BRC-100 compliant wallet
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent API across all implementations
- **Multiple Substrates**: Supports various communication methods
- **Future Proof**: Unchanging standard ensures long-term compatibility

## Implementation

The BSV TypeScript SDK implements BRC-100 through the `WalletClient` class, which provides:

- Transaction creation and signing
- UTXO management
- Authentication and authorization
- Substrate-agnostic communication
